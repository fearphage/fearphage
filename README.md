# Phred -- @fearphage

I'm a full-stack developer. I've created front ends, back ends, automated deployments, managed
Kubernetes, and everything in between.

I believe in most cases I end up being most well-known for pushing unit testing (TDD where possible),
security, automating any and everything, simplifiying developer workflows, keeping dependencies and
environments up to date, and single-responsibility apps.

I'm currently working at GLG on the DevOps team. I've helped move our team from antiquated
technology to more modern Docker-based deployments.
